                        <h3>Week 1</h3>
                        <p>On my first day, the company oriented us to their company's rules and regulations, helping us get familiar with the environment. Throughout the week, we learned how to change and test ink colors for printers. They also guided us through PC assembly, and I even got the chance to boot a computer to Windows 11 and activate Microsoft Office.</p>

                        <h3>Week 2</h3>
                        <p>During our second week, we continued with PC assembly and were also tasked with data encoding. We attended webinars that demonstrated how Canon printers are assembled and disassembled. I also helped out on the second floor, assisting with sorting and scanning documents.</p>

                        <p>This week involved the usual tasks: more PC assembly, monitor testing, and sorting documents. It was all pretty fun, as we had already gotten used to handling the paperwork and testing procedures.</p>

                        <p>For this week, we focused on more PC assembly. There's a picture that really captures our happiness when we finally made the PC assembly work, even after weeks of doing it! We were also assigned to code an inventory system for the company boss within just one week. While we couldn't add all the functions due to the tight deadline, we truly tried our best and were incredibly happy that we accomplished it together as a team.</p>
